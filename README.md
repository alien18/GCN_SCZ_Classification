# GCN_SCZ_Classification

This repository provides core codes and toolboxes for analysis in the paper entitled "Graph convolutional networks reveal network-level functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia" by Lei et al. Please see the paper for the description of data analysis.

# Overview
Content includes demo data and source code for the implementation of graph convolutional network (GCN), linear support vector machine (SVM) and non-linear SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel on a large multi-site schizophrenia fMRI dataset. All custom codes were tested on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS PC.

# Requirements
- Python (>= 3.5)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pytorch
- Pytorch-geometric
- Scipy
- Numpy
- Pandas
